Introduction
------------

[Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) (Statistics with interactive R learning) is an upcoming R package that aims to provide a platform/toolkit for learning statistics and data analysis within the R environment itself. [astRowRap](http://astrowrap-dev.github.io/astrowrap/) intends to leverage this platform for creating a set of lessons in R and data analysis laced with examples from Astronomy and thus provide an easy and guided introduction for beginners.
